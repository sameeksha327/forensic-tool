The project, *“An Activity Logger for Forensic to Retrieve User Behavior from Mobile Devices,”* focuses on extracting and analyzing user activity data from mobile devices for forensic investigations. It aims to provide investigators with a comprehensive report by aggregating data from different applications and sources. The system is designed to detect, classify, and chronologically arrange user activities while ensuring data integrity and legal compliance.  
 **Python Usage in the Project**  
Python was chosen as the primary programming language for this project due to its ease of use, extensive libraries, and support for machine learning and data processing.  

1. **Data Processing & Analysis:**  
   - **Pandas** was used for structuring and analyzing large datasets, helping to extract relevant forensic data efficiently.  
   - **NumPy** provided support for handling numerical computations and array-based operations.  

2. **Machine Learning & AI Implementation:**  
   - **TensorFlow** was employed for AI-based analysis, helping to detect patterns and anomalies in user behavior.  

3. **Data Visualization & Reporting:**  
   - **Matplotlib** was utilized to generate graphs and charts, enabling clear visual representation of extracted forensic data.  

4. **Automation & System Integration:**  
   - Python scripts automated data extraction, file classification, and report generation, improving the efficiency of forensic analysis.  

5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility & Simplicity:**  
   - Python’s versatility allowed the software to run seamlessly across different environments (Windows, Linux).  
   - Its simple syntax reduced development time and made debugging easier.  

 **Conclusion**  
Python played a crucial role in implementing data extraction, processing, visualization, and machine learning functionalities. Its powerful libraries and ease of use made it an ideal choice for forensic analysis, ensuring an efficient and scalable solution for retrieving user behavior from mobile devices.
